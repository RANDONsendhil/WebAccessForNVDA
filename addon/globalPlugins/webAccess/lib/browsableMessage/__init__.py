	A single message can be specified as the value for the `source` argument.
	A series of messages can instead be specified by passing a callback function as `source`.
	The callback function will in turn get called with the URI of the requested message.
	
	The `type` parameter specifies how the returned messages should be converted into HTML documents.
	It accepts the following values:
	 * "html": No conversion but set MIME type to "text/html".
	 * "body": The message is an HTML snippet that gets wrapped as the content of the `body` element
	   of a basic HTML document template.
	 * "markdown": The message is formatted in markdown and gets converted into HTML.
	 * "text": The message is plain text and gets displayed in the regular paragraph body style. No HTML code is interpreted.
	 * "plain": The message is plain text and gets displayed in a monospace font style. No HTML code is interpreted.
	
	If `source` is a callback function and a `type` is specified, the callback is expected to return
	the content as a string or bytearray.
	If `source` is a callback function and no `type` is specified, the callback is expected to return
	a dictionary with the following items:
	 - "mimeType", mapping to the MIME type of the content
	 - and either "stream", mapping to a file-like object to the content
	 - or "data", mapping to a string or bytearray representation of the content
	
	URLs starting with a leading forward slash ("/") are treated as file URLs.
	`rootDirs` specifies the sequence of directories in which files are looked up.
	If omitted, files are looked up in the user configuration directory.
